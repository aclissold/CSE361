Exercise 2.2-3

DESCRIPTION:

Consider linear search again (see Exercise 2.1-3). How many elements of the input sequence need to
be checked on the average, assuming that the element being search for is equally likely to be any
element in the array? How about in the worst case? What are the average-case and worst-case running
times of linear search in Θ-notation? Justify your answers.

SOLUTION:

On average, n/2 elements must be checked. Assuming it's an even distribution, the best case is when
it's the first element and the worst case is when it's the last, so on average it will tend to fall
halfway between these.

The worst case of it being the last element requires n elements to be checked.

It's fairly straightforward to see that checking n elements of the array leads to a worst-case
running time of Θ(n). An average-case running time is Θ(n/2), but since constant factors don't
adversely affect asymptotic growth, this is a Θ(n) running time as well.
