Exercise 5.2-4

DESCRIPTION:

Use indicator random variables to solve the following problem, which is known as the "hat-check
problem." Each of n customers gives a hat to a hat-check person at a restaurant. The hat-check
person gives the hats back to the customers in a random order. What is the expected number of
customers who get back their own hat?

SOLUTION:

Let Xi be an indicator random variable denoting whether customer number i gets their hat back
or not. Then,

    Xi = I{proper hat returned to customer i}
       = { 1 if proper hat returned to customer i,
         { 0 if proper hat not returned to customer i,

and

    X = X1 + X2 + ... + Xn.

By Lemma 5.1, E[Xi] = Pr{proper hat returned to customer i}. Then,

    E[X] = E[(sum from i = 1 to n of Xi)]
         = sum from i = 1 to n of E[Xi]
         = sum from i = 1 to n of (1/i)
         = ln n + O(1),

as in the HIRE-ASSISTANT algorithm.
